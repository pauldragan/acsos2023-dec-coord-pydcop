.. _pydcop_commands_agent:

pydcop agent
============

``pydcop agent`` runs one or several standalone agent(s).


Synopsis
--------

::

  pydcop agent --names <names>
               [--address <ip_address>] --port <start_port>
               --orchestrator <orchestrator_address>
               [--uiport <start_uiport>]
               [--restart]


Description
-----------

Starts one or several agents. No orchestrator is started, you must start it
separately  using the `:ref:`pydcop_commands_orchestrator` command.
The orchestrator might be started after or before the agents, if it is not
reachable when starting the agents, they will wait until it is available.

All agents are started in the same process and communicate with one another
using an embedded http server (each agent has its own http server). You can
run this command several time on different machines, all pointing to the same
orchestrator ; this allows to run large distributed systems.

The ui-server is a websocket server (one for each agent) that gives access to
an agent internal state. It is only needed if you intend to connect a graphical
user interface for an agent ; while it is very useful it also may have some
impact on performance and is better avoided when running a system with a large
number of agents.

**Command:** :ref:`pydcop_commands_orchestrator`

**Tutorial:** :ref:`tutorials_deploying_on_machines`


Options
-------

``-n <names>`` / ``--names <names>``
  The names of the agent(s). Notice that this needs to match the name of the
  agents expected by the orchestrator.

``--orchestrator <orchestrator_address>``
  The address of the orchestrator as <ip>:<port>

``--address <ip_address>``
  Optional IP address the orchestrator will listen on.
  If not given we try to use the primary IP address.

``-p <start_port>`` / ``--port <start_port>``
  The port on which the agent will listen for messages. If several agents
  names are started (when giving several names) this port is used for the
  first agent and increment for each subsequent agent.

``-i <start_uiport>`` / ``--uiport <start_uiport>``
  The port on which the ui-server will be listening (same behavior as
  ``--port`` when starting several agents). If not given, no ui-server will be
  started for these/this agent(s).

``--restart``
  When setting this flag, agent(s) will restarted when when they have all
  stopped. Useful when running `pydcop agent` as daemon on a remote machine.


Examples
--------

Running a single agent on port 9000, with an ui-server on port 10001::

    pydcop -v 3 agent -n a1 -p 9001 --orchestrator 127.0.0.1:9000 --uiport 10001

Running 5 agents, listening on port 9001 - 9006 (without ui-server)::

    pydcop -v 3 agent -n a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 -p 9001 --orchestrator 127.0.0.1:9000
